                        <p>Click the link below the image to view the full PDF. </p>
                        <p>The Verizon logo redesign was assigned to me as part of a regular weekly assignment.  Each designer was assigned a different company, and I had the challenge of redesigning a logo for a company that just recently had a logo redesign.</p>
                        <p>My thought process was (almost) exactly this: Verizon is not thought of for the red check the have displayed for so long.  I asked around to find if people knew the "defining" feature of the current or old logo or if they had even noticed the change.  Most could not tell me that they noticed the change, but nearly all could not associate a red check with Verizon.  Their greatest strength right now, especially in our digital world is providing high speed internet.  As such, I decided to ditch the check, and go with a wifi symbol on a slghtly more friendly font that still feel modern.</p>

                        <h2>Matt Berninger Double Exposure</h2>
                        <p>As you will see a few projects down, I really love The National.  This work was a quick double exposure experiment, using a less shapely form like water to create a restless, uneasy mood.</p>
                        <p>The inspiration for this piece comes from the feeling I get while listening to The National: literally the mood of whatever song I am listening to.  In this case, I was listening to "About Today" after a series of unfortunate happenings had unfolded consecutive days prior.  As usual, I felt the need to leave my emotions on a piece of work.</p>

                        <h2>Mirrors</h2>
                        <p>I made this piece one day after watching an episode of Stranger Things.  In the episode (SPOILERS -- kind of), 11 goes back into a sensory deprivation chamber, and inside is a black world, with a thin layer of water at the feet.</p>
                        <p>I wanted to recreate that same aesthetic, but put my own twist on it, a sort of modernistic, geometric landscape of mountains reflected on the water.</p>

                        <p>This work is the result of a midterm assignment: To create a work that could be used as a reference for a time-based piece of media.  </p>
                        <p>One of my favorite bands is The National, so using the lyrics from the song "Terrible Love", I drew up a conceptual storyboard.  I used paper and pencil, scanned the work into photoshop, and added some effects and color correction for a darker, more moody feel. </p>

                        <p>This piece was done completely in photoshop.</p>

The face was done in Adobe Illustrator, and the rest was finished in Photoshop.</p>
